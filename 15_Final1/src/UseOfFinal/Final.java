package UseOfFinal;
/* Final variables: When a variable is declared as final, its value cannot be changed once 
 it has been initialized. This is useful for declaring constants or other values that 
 should not be modified.
* Final methods: When a method is declared as final, it cannot be overridden by a subclass. 
  This is useful for methods that are part of a classâ€™s public API and should not be modified
 by subclasses.
* Final classes: When a class is declared as final, it cannot be extended by a subclass. This 
is useful for classes that are intended to be used as is and should not be modified or 
extended.
* Initialization: Final variables must be initialized either at the time of declaration or in 
the constructor of the class. This ensures that the value of the variable is set and cannot 
be changed.
* Performance: The use of a final can sometimes improve performance, as the compiler can 
optimize the code more effectively when it knows that a variable or method cannot be changed.
* Security: The final can help improve security by preventing malicious code from modifying 
  sensitive data or behavior.
